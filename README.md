I'm using EDA playground and Xilinx(ISE Design Suite) for designing and testing of the RTL codes(verilog).

Practice codes
All logic gates
Designed all the logic gates with different design style like data flow,gate level,behavioural and structural using verilog.
PROJECTS
Electronic Lock
Built an electronic combinational lock using Verilog with a reset button, two number buttons (0 and 1) and an unlock output.
The output will be Unlocked when the Sequence 01011 is entered.
Vending Machine
Designed a vending machine using Verilog that accepts only two coins(5 and 10 rupee) and give a coke When total coins equal to 15 rupees.
It will not return any residual coin, if total of rupees exceeds 15.
Trafic light controller
Designed a Traffic light controller using verilog which shows green signal for main road and red for side road at normal condition.
The signal will be yellow and then red for main road and green for side road When there will be vehicles on the side road.
SPI-based TEMPERATURE MONITOR
This project aim is to design and immplemention of a SPI-based temperature monitor.To design a controller in Verilog to read the data from the sensor ([LM70][datasheetLM70]) using the industry-standard SPI protocol, convert the data to a human readable format (deg-C) and drive a set of 7-segment display to display the data. In order to test the Verilog code in realtime application, the Verilog code will be synthesized into a Xilinx's Spartan FPGA board.

** currently working on it.
